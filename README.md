# comfyui-electron

# Overview

This electron app is the simplest way to use [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) comes bundled with a few things:

- [standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) python runtime
- comfyui manager [core](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/manager-core)
- [comfy-cli](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-cli)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

On startup, it will install all the necessary python dependencies and start the server.

We publish updates in line with the stable releases of ComfyUI.

The app uses our electron update server hosted at https://updater.comfy.org.

## ComfyUI Files

ComfyUI files like models, inputs, outputs, custom_nodes and saved workflows are placed here:

Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/ComfyUI/...`

Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI`

## Logs

We use electron-log to log everything to a local file.

```
on Linux: ~/.config/{app name}/logs/main.log
on macOS: ~/Library/Logs/{app name}/main.log
on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\{app name}\logs\main.log
```

# Development

## Setup Yarn

This project uses `yarn` as its package manager. If you do not already have a `yarn` binary available on your PATH, run:

```bash
# corepack is a set of utilities included with all recent distributions of node
corepack enable
yarn set version stable
```

This will install a usable `yarn` binary. Then, in the root directory of this repo (ie adjacent to the top-level package.json file), run:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Setup Python

Make sure you have python 3.12+ installed. It is recommended to setup a virtual environment to run the python code.

Linux/MacOS:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

## Setup comfy-cli

With the python environment activated, install comfy-cli:

```bash
pip install comfy-cli
```

## Building/running

First, initialize the application resources by running `make:assets:<gpu>`:

```bash
# populate the assets/ dir (Installs a fresh ComfyUI instance under assets/)
yarn make:assets:[amd|cpu|nvidia|macos]
```

You can then run `start` to build/launch the code and a live buildserver that will automatically rebuild the code on any changes:

```bash
yarn start
```

You can also build the package and/or distributables using the `package` and `make` commands:

```bash
# build the platform-dependent package
yarn package
```

```bash
# build the platform-dependent package and any distributables
yarn make
```

## Utility scripts

A number of utility scripts are defined under the "scripts" field of package.json. For example, to build the project, run:

```bash
yarn make
```

Then, to clean up the build artifacts you can run:

```bash
yarn clean

# clean:slate also removes node_modules
yarn clean:slate
```
